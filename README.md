# GitHub Game Jam 2024

## Game: ShadowLink Command

My entry for the 2024 gamejam. You play as a computer-hacker, finding usernames and passwords to access new servers, building up your own network of servers.

## Development

Team: 1, just me.

## Play the game

https://tmachine.itch.io/shadowlink-command (itch.io playable link)

## Technology

- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React
- MaterialUI

# Updates / Ideas / Requests / Releases

There's a dedicated Discord for the game: https://discord.gg/UGp2d8DcNQ

# Source code

This really isn't good code! I wouldn't recommend using it for anything - it was thrown together in a hurry over weekends and evenings for the game-jam. This is some of the worst code I've written for a game. I was in a serious hurry ...

## Assets

The assets (images, text files) that affect gameplay are included in the assets folder - the game creates a virtual HDD using the subfolder there. All other assets (custom art, custom music) are not included - I may distribute them later.
